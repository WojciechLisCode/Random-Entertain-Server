## <p align="center"> App description: </p>

Random Entertain. was made to answer the question "What should I watch next?". It was a group project, made close to the end of Coddaisseur Coding Academy, with my three colleges: [Connor Young](https://github.com/TheCrazedLime), [Sentwali Dors](https://github.com/STNyame), and [Rafael Fontes Baptista](https://github.com/Rafael-Fontes-Baptista). It provides random title (from 200 most popular) based on applied filters.

## <p align="center"> App features/User stories: </p>

1. ### Header.
<p> The main purpose of the Header is to allow users to log in, signup, or log out. Users can switch between the login and signup options while using the same text inputs for both. When the user is logged in, additional button to render the watchlist component is displayed. </p>

2. ### Main component.

<p>Within the main component, users can select preferred filters. Every time there is a change made to filters, an appropriate random title is fetched from the database. If the user wants to see a different title without changing filters it can be done with the "RANDOMIZE!" button. In case when the user is satisfied with the result, the title can be stored in his watchlist. </p>

## <p align="center"> To be implented: </p>

1. ### Expanded the title info:

<p>Users should have an option to access more information about the title, preferably the trailer of the movie. Use of a second API might be needed.</p>
